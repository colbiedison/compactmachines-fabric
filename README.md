## Compact Machines

These are the main component of this mod and allow you to build complicated machine contraptions and hide them within a single Compact Machine block.

#### Sizes
There are 6 different sizes of machines:

| Name                        | Description  |
| ----------------------------| -------------|
| Tiny                        | 3x3x3        |
| Small                       | 5x5x5        |
| Normal                      | 7x7x7        |
| Large                       | 9x9x9        |
| Giant                       | 11x11x11     |
| Maximum                     | 13x13x13     |

#### Personal Shrinking Device

This little tool allows you to enter your Compact Machines. Right clicking a Compact Machine world will teleport you inside.

#### Spawn location

By default, you spawn in the center of the room. You can change this by shift-right-clicking a Personal Shrinking Device at the location you want to set the spawn to.

Make sure not to obstruct the spawn location, there is currently no mechanic to automatically search for a better spawn location. You don't want to have to break the blocks you spawn in.
